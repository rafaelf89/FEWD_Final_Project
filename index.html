<h3><center>I would like to show on this page some of my admiration for sharks. These two that I show here, the White Shark and the Hammerhead, are my favorites. <br>
I have a dream of one day being able to swim with them, as I'm not completely crazy yet, I'll go into a cage, lol. <br>
In the following section, you can see some curiosities and right after that there are 2 links that will show more details and photos of the 2 sharks mentioned. <br>
Enjoy
